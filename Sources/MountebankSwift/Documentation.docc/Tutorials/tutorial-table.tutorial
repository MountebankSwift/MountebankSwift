        [MountebankSwift](https://github.com/MountebankSwift/MountebankSwift/) is a client library for [Mountebank](https://www.mbtest.org/), an open source tool that provide cross-platform, multi-protocol test doubles over the wire. Simply point your application under test to Mountebank instead of the server, and test like you would with traditional stubs and mocks.
        
        In this tuturial you'll learn everything about MountebankSwift and mock some network requests!
        
        There's also a video version of thuis guide available: [ðŸŽ¬ Elevating UI Tests with network mocking
