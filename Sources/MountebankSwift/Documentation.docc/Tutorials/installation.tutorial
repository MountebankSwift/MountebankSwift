            First, we'll install Mountebank to our system.             
        }
            
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Using our terminal, we'll install Mountebank. If you don't have ``npm`` installed, you can install it with brew using ``$ brew install node``
                
                @Code(name: "installation", file: npm_install.sh)
            }
            
            @Step {
                This will install Mountebank and it's required dependencies
                
                @Code(name: "installation", file: npm_installed.sh)
            }
        }

        @ContentAndMedia {
            @Image(source: "MountebankSwift.png", alt: "The Mountebank logo a charlatan holding a bottle with the logo of Swift placed on the bottle")
            
            Next we'll add MountebankSwift to our project             
        }
            
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                A) Go to **File** -> **Add Package Dependency**
                
                or, alternatively, option B) Go to your project file, select **Package Dependencies** and click the **plus icon**

            @Step {
                In the text field at the top right, paste the link to the repo.

            }
            
            @Step {
                Finally, make sure you add MountebankSwift to our **UI test target**, not the main app. And hit **Add Package**
